# MyBand
 This project where i made use of my first PHP template parser called "Smarty".
 
 I Made use of a switch case in the [Index.php](https://github.com/bikerboyasd/MyBand/blob/master/myband/index.php) 
 wich then includes everything from the [Views folder](https://github.com/bikerboyasd/MyBand/blob/master/myband/views)
 in there you will only find `.tpl` files wich i use with smarty in order to easily make views with php data.
 
 I kept all of the `logic` away from the `views` so that it doesnt get mixed up and all messy
 you can see the `logic` in the [Logic folder](https://github.com/bikerboyasd/MyBand/blob/master/myband/logic).
